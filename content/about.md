This is a personal blog where I might occasionally post about things that interest me, mostly coffee-related.
    </p>
    <p>
I enjoy thinking, talking and writing about <strong>coffee</strong> and messing about with data. I was previously an Economist at the International Coffee Organization, working on market analysis and statistics.
